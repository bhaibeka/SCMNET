-feature selection:  selecting 10 gene pairs and computing likelihood

12/10/12
-determined the weighted probability for each subtype using lapply:  had an issue with weighted.means as even when I inputed the subtype.weights it continued to weight everything as 1, and then I finally realized that I was using nrows when I should have been using ncol in my apply.  Moving on â€¦ 

-12/11/12
-wrote a function top.features to find the difference between each subtype and the mean of other subtypes for each gene pair.
-will determine top 10 features for each subtype tomorrow.

-12/12/12
-added to the top.features function to return the top gene pairs for each subtype
-need to include more comments above function
-teleconference with Dr. Haibe-Kains at 3:00pm
